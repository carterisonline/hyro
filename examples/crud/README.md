# Example - CRUD

A basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing TODOs. Uses SQLite globally to persist state.

## Additional Libraries Used

- [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) for querying SQLite.
- [hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org/) for updating client-side templates. The attribute `_=`
  is used to define hyperscript behavior for UI elements.
- [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/) for the page's global semantic style.
- [basicGrid](https://basicgrid.electerious.com/) for simple flexbox-based row/column layouts.
